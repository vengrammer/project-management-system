DESCRIPTION:
    This Project Management System is designed to organize and track all project records in one place. It displays important project details such as the project title, cost, assigned employees, and current status. The admin or project creator can create projects, define tasks, and assign those tasks to specific employees. Employees can view their assigned tasks and update their progress accordingly.

    The system allows users to monitor whether a project is completed, ongoing, or stuck, making it easier to identify issues and track accountability. Overall, the system helps improve workflow, transparency, and collaboration by clearly showing who is responsible for each task and the current progress of every project.
